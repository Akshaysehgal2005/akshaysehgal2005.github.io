									Objective was to predict how popular an apartment rental listing is based on the listing content like text description, photos, number of bedrooms, price, etc. The data comes from renthop.com, an apartment listing website. I created an ensemble model using xgboost wrapped in a cross validator, stacked over KazAnova's StackNet with random forest and SVM. Features used included basic features, simple calculated features, constructed features over manager_id using tf-idf and clustered longitude-latitude positions, and finally magic feature. Model iterations were done with parameter tuning followed by averaging and geometric mean of predictions. The accuracy measure was log loss and my best model got me top 7% global ranking on Kaggle.</p>

								<p>
									Careerletics Enterprise is an intelligent platform for recruiters which assists them with pre-hire decision making and reduces the hiring lifecycle from a few weeks to a few minutes. It assists a recruiter by parsing resume data, quantifying candidate metrics, calculating relevance against a job description and ranking candidates by a metric called employability score. First, an exhaustive database linking industries & functions to skill sets, companies, job positions and colleges was created by using natural language processing over a database of half a million resumes documents (without any specific template). This database was then utilized to identify qualification, skills and experience information from user resumes via a parser. This was coupled with a chatbot to collect missing candidate information directly. Next, a stacked model for filtering, relevance matching, and competitive ranking was developed. Candidates which were finally selected by the recruiter are captured and used as a feedback the self-learning algorithm to adjust parameter weights. The platform and algorithm are patented under iPredictt Data Science Labs.</p>

								</h5>
			
								<p>
									A Fortune 500 Casino Giant used certain business rules to calculate ADT (Accumulated daily theoretical win) for each of their customers to decide the category of their marketing spend which had an extremely low accuracy (32%). The objective was to build a regression model to predict ADT values for customers based on gambling spends, wins and other visit information. An ensemble model was created based on analysis of variation in the test variable (ADT). A certain segment of the customer population (which was primarily low spend customers) was tackled using generalized linear models while remaining segment (which comprised primarily of high spend customers) was tackled using 11 separate Support Vector Machine classification models. The test variable for these was bucketed into spend categories instead of using a continuous ADT value. The accuracy of this model was much higher than the base model (53%). The exercise was followed by creating a financial modeling simulator using these predictions to generate best and worst case profit/loss scenarios over variable marketing spends.</p>

								<p>
									The 2nd largest toy manufacturer brand showed quarter on quarter ROI decline of 20% which amplified further during the latest holiday season. Clear understanding was required on what were the prime causes of this decline. A five dimension deterministic model was created to analyze parameters calculated through web analytics. This model was then passed through regression analysis for generating estimates for each parameter as a substitute for driver towards the sales decline. A major realization by the end of the exercise was that the decline was primarily due to cannibalization by a fresh brand they launched themselves but for a higher age category. This allowed them to take major decisions in time to stabilize the curve to around 8% decline in the coming quarter and also affected the launch dates of their upcoming brands.</p>

									Client was the world's biggest home improvement retail company. They were on a pilot with Brickstream, which is a Video analytics software which uses aisle camera footage to virtually create trip lines and dwell zones. Exhaustive reports were created for the data collected by Bricksteam enabled cameras on a weekly level. Trip line analysis allowed client to predict traffic hours in real time and accordingly align their store associates for coming days/weeks, thereby improving resource management. Dwell analysis enabled the client to understand dwell times of customers at specific aisles positions thereby enabling them to take decisions on shelf space management.</p>

					  <h5><b>#DataScience #NaiveBayes #Notebook</b></h5>
                      <p>In this notebook I try to explore the intuition behind the probabilistic modelling techinque called Naive Bayes and its various classifiers. Understanding the implementation of each of these classifiers is important as they come with their own assumptions over the naive assumption of the algorithm itself. An deeper look at the implementation of these classifiers and the mathematics behind them can shine more light to the intuition behind this widely used algorithm that forms a foundation for a large number of other more complex methods in supervised classification....</p>

					  <h5><b>#DataScience #MissingData #Notebook</b></h5>
                      <p>Missing data is the nemesis of every data scientist, specially if they are still new to the field. We are all facinated by new algorithms and don't miss a single chance to apply them on every dataset we can get our hands on. But, alas, missing data becomes a major barrier between that dream, unless it can be handled properly. I learnt my lesson long back and while I know people who are wizards at data handling (one function to rule them all), I fortunately/unfortunately prefer simple short steps to handle missing data so as to verify each step. With what little python programming I can muster, I present to you the standard and advance Missing Data handling techniques I have learnt over the years....</p>

					  <h5><b>#Literature #Raindrops #MumbaiRains</b></h5>
                      <p>Mid June, the heavy breeze pulls the beautiful puffs of vapor over the busy folk of Mumbai. Walking to my office I take a quick peek at the sky. "I wish it rains today", I think to myself and move on. Thats my world, the world of a social animal. I, like all those I know, have come to embrace the monotony. But somewhere high up in the sky, a little vapor from a small lake near a small village outside Mumbai, suddenly found himself among millions, if not billions of other vapors just like him, all floating together. They didnt act, they didnt react, they just followed their shepherd, the wind. They all trusted this current, this force of nature their master....</p>

					  <h5><b>#DataScience #Visualizations #Seaborn #Notebook</b></h5>
                      <p>Distributions, correlations and data variability are some of the most important tasks before feature engineering begins. One may consider these as the first major project stage a Data Scientist needs to be able to perform. A thorough exploration has not only helped me understand the data at hand, but also form basic notions about the ballparks and behavior of given features. Ballparks help a data scientist avoid logical errors during feature engineering. In this notebook I detail the most effective way I found to generate charts in a standardized way for understanding data during the exploration phase of the project. These primarily utilize the grid method to create a canvas for then plotting charts by categories. In a sense, its similar to data grouping in a visual way....</p>

					  <h5><b>#DataScience #DataGrouping #Notebook</b></h5>
                      <p>Data Grouping is probably the most used concept in the field of data analysis. Almost every scripting language builds its foundation over grouping data by categories of a multi-dimensional variable. A data scientist uses this for summarizing data for analysis as well as changing the level at which data can be useful for a model. Example, transaction level data needs to be summarized at customer level data before predicting their spend. Usecases like these are where languages like SQL are very useful with their group by clauses. However python isn't too far behind. Pandas provides a large variety of methods which do so much more than the standard SQL grouping. This combined with the aggregate methods gives a Data Scientist a strong grasp over data handling....</p>
