		<h1><b>The Tale of a Raindrop</b></h1>

		<p>Mid June, the heavy breeze pulls the beautiful puffs of vapor over the busy folk of Mumbai. Walking to my office I take a quick peek at the sky. "I wish it rains today", i think to myself and move on. Thats my world, the world of a social animal. I, like all those I know, have come to embrace the monotony. But somewhere high up in the sky, a little vapor from a small lake near a small village outside Mumbai, suddenly found himself among millions, if not billions of other vapors just like him, all floating together. They didnt act, they didnt react, they just followed their shepherd, the wind. They all trusted this current, this force of nature their master.</p>
		
		<p>"The wind is strong this part of the year" thought the little vapor, as it clung tightly to the cloud, fearing the vast nothingness of the sky. Too little to survive alone in the scary blue, and too light to drop down to the beautiful green, he waited in this dull white, for his destiny to reveal itself. He, like all others around him, knew that one day he would drop down to the wonderous rock he saw below him. An invisible force almost like gravity, pulled him towards the green sphere, somewhere deep inside him he knew he belonged down there.</p>
		
		<p>But he never thought too hard about when he would reach his destination. Though he did dream about how it would happen. Would he drop on the head of a child who would raise his little arms in the air welcoming him and his kind? Or would he fall on a dormant seed and spring it to life? Would he end up in a puddle on a broken pavement, only to be pulled back into the sky the next morning? Or will he end up in a fast stream that would take him the oceans? But no matter what he believed in, he knew he would never be in control of the outcome, for it was the almighty wind that would decide the when and the where. He flew over mountains, the rivers, the forests made of concrete, and the dead pools of pure blue. New vapors joined the race, and some old ones disappeared. Days and nights flew by, the monotony prevailed.</p>
		
		<p>Then one day, just as the last few rays from the sun had swept past the globe, the wind grew restless and the cloud started to speed up. The vapor took notice, and what he saw was no less than a wonder. It was as if heaven itself was being created right before him, a gathering of clouds in such vast numbers and sizes! The countless number of vapors of all colors clinging to their own kind, their own separate nations.</p>

		<p>All he could hear was the sound of wind rushing in all directions, howling, pausing for breath and then howling again. Suddenly an explosion interrupted the restlessness of the wind. The sharp sound of thunder followed by its echo fading. It was as if Zeus had made his appearence. "Behold!", he thundered, as he looked down on the mob of vapors. An eerie silence fell as he ascended to his throne, "Now, Begin". And the winds began the dance of death as commanded. To the little vapor it was like the end of the world. Separated from his cloud, the other vapors he had know throughout his early days, thrown into empty sky and then caught by an unknown group of vapors. He looked up and saw some other vapors reaching out for him.</p>
		
		<p><b>"Come with us, for the journey"</b></p>
		
		<p>Without thinking twice he joined this group of strangers, as they fell slowly towards the green earth. The invisible force now grew stronger as they left the chaos in the skies. He looked around. Billions of vapors now holding each other forming crystals, all reaching for the same target. But, instead of looking down, to finally see what he had been dreaming about all this time, he looked back, he saw the cloud that had shown him the world. A strange feeling came over him. A feeling of satisfaction, a feeling you get when you achieve what you desire the most.</p>
		
		<p>And then he realized, that no matter where he ended up now, what he would really cherish, was the journey, not the destination...</p>
